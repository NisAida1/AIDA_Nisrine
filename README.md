## About Me 👋

Hi everyone, Nisrine Aida here 👋

I’m a passionate Data Analyst and a 2nd-year Engineering student at EILCO Calais, specializing in data science. I love working with data, solving problems, and turning information into insights.

Although I’m just starting my professional journey in data analytics, I’ve completed several projects and earned certifications that strengthened my skills in Python, SQL, Power BI ... .

I’m currently looking for an end-of-year internship and a work-study contract for my 3rd year, where I can apply my knowledge, grow as a Data Analyst, and contribute to real-world projects.

I’m always excited to connect with professionals or other aspiring data analysts to share ideas and experiences!
Feel free to DM me if you’d like to connect or discuss opportunities.

### Database  & SQL 
I work with both relational and non-relational databases to store and analyze data.  
I use SQL to write queries for data extraction, filtering, joins, and aggregations, and I have a basic understanding of NoSQL databases such as MongoDB.  
Through projects and coursework, I am learning how to design simple database structures and work with different data models.
